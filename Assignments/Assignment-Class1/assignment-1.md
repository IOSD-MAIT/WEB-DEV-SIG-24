# Web-Development SIG 2023-2024

## 1.) GitHub Account
Make your github accounts if not already and make yourself familiar with by uploading some files and messing around with it.
(You can also refer to some online tutorials to guide you or feel free to ask us, if you are facing issues.)

## 2.) Your First Web-Page
From what we covered in our class, you have to create a simple web-page, using atleast lists, anchor tags  and heading tags.
There is no proper structure to be followed so let, your imagination run wild! :)
(Feel free to google up the anything you don't understand as long as you don't just blindly copy pasting stuff, you will be good.)

## 3.) Upload it on GitHub
Now that you have build your first web-page, it's time to share it with the world!
Upload it on GitHub by creating a new repository.

## 4.) Host it on GitHub Pages
To make your first website up and running for the whole world to see, host it on github pages.

SEE YOU ALL NEXT WEEK!!
